# Udacity Project no. 5: Multi-Screen Apps

# Musical Structure App

## Description: 
Design and layout the flow for the structure of a Music Player app. 
For this project, the app does not actually need to play music.

## Requirements:
* The app’s structure is suitable for a music player app. 
* The purpose of each activity is easy for a user to understand through the UI design and feature labeling.
* The app contains 2 to 6 activities
* Each activity contains button(s) which link it to other activities a user should be able to reach from that activity. For instance, a ‘Library’ activity might contain a button to move to the ‘Now Playing’ activity.
* Data about each song (or equivalent audio media such as podcast episode) should be stored in a custom class that contains at least 2 states (e.g. Song Name, Artist Name)
* If images are included (e.g. Album Art), they are stored as drawables. All drawables are stored at multiple densities. Images are not required.

## Optional:
* Implemented ViewHolder pattern
* Integrated Butteknife library - field and method binding for Android views which uses annotation processing to generate boilerplate code.
